Known Bugs

1. Bash script named "run.bash" in work directory needs to invoke
   "bash -l" at start in order to run correctly in batch mode. This
   forces the script to read the users ~/.bashrc file. An attempt
   was made to circumvent this by putting a copy of the required bashrc commands
   in files "bashrc_system.bash" and "bashrc_ext_system.bash" which are sourced
   by bash_wfirst.bash. This did not work.
